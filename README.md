# Hostel-Recommendation-System

In a bustling city like Bangalore, where Christ University students come from far and wide, the need for a hostel recommendation system becomes essential to simplify their accommodation search. For that, a personalized PG/Hostel Recommendation System was developed that leverages cutting-edge content-based and location-based filtering techniques to enhance the efficiency of student accommodation search.
This innovative system harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Tokenization, Stopwords Removal, Lemmatization, and Cosine Similarity. By doing so, it creates a tailored recommendation system designed specifically for Christ University students, ensuring that they find accommodations that perfectly match their needs and preferences.
